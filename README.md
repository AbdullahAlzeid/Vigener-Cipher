# Vigenère Cipher Implementation

## Overview
This repository contains a Java implementation of the Vigenère Cipher, a method of encrypting alphabetic text through a simple form of polyalphabetic substitution. The implementation includes both encryption and decryption functionalities.

## Features
- **Encryption**: Encrypts plain text using the Vigenère Cipher technique.
- **Decryption**: Decrypts the text encrypted by the Vigenère Cipher.
- **Custom Key**: Allows the use of a custom key for encryption and decryption.
- **File Handling**: Reads input from and writes output to text files.

## How to Run
To run the application:
1. Ensure Java is installed on your system.
2. Clone the repository.
3. Compile and run `VigenereCipher.java` located in the `Vigener` folder.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to perform encryption or decryption.

## Key Components
- **VigenereCipher.java**: The main class that handles the Vigenère Cipher logic. ([VigenereCipher.java](https://github.com/AbdullahAlzeid/Vigener-Cipher/blob/main/Vigener/VigenereCipher.java))
- **Encryption.txt**: An example input file for encryption. ([Encryption.txt](https://github.com/AbdullahAlzeid/Vigener-Cipher/blob/main/Vigener/Encryption.txt))

## Usage
- Run `VigenereCipher.java` and choose between encryption and decryption.
- Provide the necessary input as prompted, including the path to the input file and the encryption/decryption key.
- The program will process the input and output the results to the specified files.
